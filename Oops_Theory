OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING:
----------------------------
--Python program can be written in TWO ways
--1. procedural oriented programming
        top to bottom procedure
        where program is executed from top to bottom
 2. Object oriented programming
      --bottom to up programming
      --in this style of program
      we will be getting certain advantages or features
      i. abstraction
      ii. encapsulation
      iii.inheritance
      iv. polymorphism
      v. exception handling
--Definition of abstraction:
        object information hiding is called
        mobile: UI, but inside hardware and software
        how they have been wrapped.
        --design level concept
--Encapsulation:
        binding/wrapping hardware and software
        together as embedded is called
        --hiding object only
        --it is implementation level concept
--class and object concept
--olden days:
        books need to be maintained.
        registration office maintain on paper documentation
        bank also maintains books
 --Digital data: u can not use paper
 --u will be searching features and feedback in internet or website
 --ex: Realme pro 12
 class realme_pro_12:
      model
      company
      color
      price
      b_backup
      screen_size
      mobile_summarize() #method
      buy()
      cancel()
      add_to_cart()
      add_address()
      payment()
 #ex2:
 write class and object info for the student
 class student:
      rollno
      name
      aadhar
      pancard
      emcet rank
      father_name
      mother_name
      address
      about_student(rollno)
      marks_student()
      attendance_of_student()
      switch_to_other_college()
      cancel_seat()
      monitor_class_room()
